Over the past several years, our team has seen certain communities across the world blast off with robust access to information and tech while others wallow behind. The has resulted in distrust and conflict: while certain communities tend to make claims backed academic knowledge, other communities simply lack the technical knowledge to verify those claims, creating a general information divide in the world. Take COVID-19 for example—well-educated communities were well-equipped to make and understand analytically-driven public health guidelines while those without access to education and technology were simply not equipped with the tools or knowledge necessary to verify the reasoning behind those guidelines. As we have all seen, this disparity has resulted in a lack of trust between communities.

Our project easyML attempts to solve this communal disparity. Machine learning has allowed so many communities to make so many fascinating advancements—but at the same time, its complexity has left so many communities in the dust. We seek to make machine learning extremely easy for anyone to use. Literally anyone. With our website, all you need to do is upload a data set, and easyML will guide you through the rest. No parameter tuning, no model selection, no complexity at all. Through Tangram, we’ve engineered a tool that we hope has lowered the barrier for those seeking to understand the information of the world.
